<p>Taken from Psalm 137 (here are some of the surrounding verses for context):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept<br>
      when we remembered Zion.<br>
2 There on the poplars<br>
      we hung our harps,<br>
3 for there our captors asked us for songs,<br>
      our tormentors demanded songs of joy;<br>
      they said, “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”</p>
<p>4 How can we sing the songs of the Lord<br>
         while in a foreign land?<br>
5 If I forget you, Jerusalem,<br>
         may my right hand forget its skill.<br>
6 May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth<br>
         if I do not remember you,<br>
     if I do not consider Jerusalem<br>
     my highest joy.</p></blockquote>
