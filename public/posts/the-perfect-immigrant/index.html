    <meta name="description" content="I thought it appropriate to write on a subject close to the heart of the theme of this blog. The topic of immigration has earned many headlines recently, though immigration itself is nothing new. From the earliest recordings of history there have been accounts of people groups living in the midst of other people groups, or minorities among a majority. And though we may be tempted to think of it as a new trend, issue or threat, the reality is that it is not. Virtually all people groups in history have had to deal with the question of living in the same space with other people groups. My concern here is not necessarily specific policies or theories on dealing with immigration, rather my concern is to delve into what drives our values and thoughts that lead to the formation of those policies. For I have participated in or least heard many discussions related to immigration, but rarely do those conversations begin with or even include a discussion of a Biblical view of immigration. Not surprisingly, given that the nation of Israel occupied a region that contained many different people groups both in and around its territory, the Bible does address the issue of immigration. And since there are so many verses that at least mention the topic, rather than include them all in the body of this article, I will leave a (hopefully) comprehensive list at the end of the post, and merely bring attention to some of the more thematic verses here:">

    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I thought it appropriate to write on a subject close to the heart of the theme of this blog. The topic of immigration has earned many headlines recently, though immigration itself is nothing new. From the earliest recordings of history there have been accounts of people groups living in the midst of other people groups, or minorities among a majority. And though we may be tempted to think of it as a new trend, issue or threat, the reality is that it is not. Virtually all people groups in history have had to deal with the question of living in the same space with other people groups. My concern here is not necessarily specific policies or theories on dealing with immigration, rather my concern is to delve into what drives our values and thoughts that lead to the formation of those policies. For I have participated in or least heard many discussions related to immigration, but rarely do those conversations begin with or even include a discussion of a Biblical view of immigration. Not surprisingly, given that the nation of Israel occupied a region that contained many different people groups both in and around its territory, the Bible does address the issue of immigration. And since there are so many verses that at least mention the topic, rather than include them all in the body of this article, I will leave a (hopefully) comprehensive list at the end of the post, and merely bring attention to some of the more thematic verses here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall not oppress a sojourner. You know the heart of a sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
[ <cite>Exodus 23:9</cite> ]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And you shall not strip your vineyard bare, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the LORD your God. [ <cite>Leviticus 19:10</cite> ]|</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native. [ <cite>Numbers 9:14</cite> ]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you, a statute forever throughout your generations. You and the sojourner shall be alike before the LORD. One law and one rule shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you. [ <cite>Numbers 15:15-16</cite> ]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. [19] Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. [ <cite>Deuteronomy 10:18-19</cite> ]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall not oppress a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your brothers or one of the sojourners who are in your land within your towns. [ <cite>Deuteronomy 24:14</cite> ]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cursed be anyone who perverts the justice due to the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ [ <cite>Deuteronomy 27:19</cite> ]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land, and a man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. [ <cite>Ruth 1:1</cite> ]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul. [ <cite>1 Peter 2:11</cite> ]</p></blockquote>
