      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought it appropriate to write on a subject close to the heart of the theme of this blog. The topic of immigration has earned many headlines recently, though immigration itself is nothing new. From the earliest recordings of history there have been accounts of people groups living in the midst of other people groups, or minorities among a majority. And though we may be tempted to think of it as a new trend, issue or threat, the reality is that it is not. Virtually all people groups in history have had to deal with the question of living in the same space with other people groups. My concern here is not necessarily specific policies or theories on dealing with immigration, rather my concern is to delve into what drives our values and thoughts that lead to the formation of those policies. For I have participated in or least heard many discussions related to immigration, but rarely do those conversations begin with or even include a discussion of a Biblical view of immigration. Not surprisingly, given that the nation of Israel occupied a region that contained many different people groups both in and around its territory, the Bible does address the issue of immigration. And since there are so many verses that at least mention the topic, rather than include them all in the body of this article, I will leave a (hopefully) comprehensive list at the end of the post, and merely bring attention to some of the more thematic verses here:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
