The tagline *How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?*[^bignote] was a lament of the Israelites while in exile. How were they to worship when their center of worship was not only hundreds of kilometers away, but also in shambles. How were they to worship when there was seemingly no hope of fulfilling the promises their God made to them to become a great nation?  My intent is to explore this same problem for us today. How do we, as citizens of heaven, sojourners on this earth, make sense of everything around us? How do we deal with and navigate the messiness of this fallen world? As things happen, as things fall apart, how do we maintain an eternal perspective? How do we fight the good fight? In sum, how do we worship?







[^bignote]: Taken from Psalm 137 (here are some of the surrounding verses for context):

    >1 By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; when we remembered Zion.  
    >2 There on the poplars  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; we hung our harps,  
    >3 for there our captors asked us for songs,  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; our tormentors demanded songs of joy;  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; they said, “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”  
    >
    >4 How can we sing the songs of the Lord  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;    while in a foreign land?  
    >5 If I forget you, Jerusalem,  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;    may my right hand forget its skill.  
    >6 May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;    if I do not remember you,  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;if I do not consider Jerusalem  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;my highest joy.
